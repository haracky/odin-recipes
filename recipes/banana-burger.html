        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p id="description">You've never had a burger quite like this before. Legend has it Elvis loved his peanut butter, bacon, and banana sandwiches, so we created this salty, sweet burger as a tribute to the king of rock 'n' roll. Piled high with creamy peanut butter, extra-crispy bacon, caramelized bananas, and a sweet honey drizzle, this totally unique combination of flavors will have you all shook up. Whether you grill the patties or cook them smash burger-style on the stovetop, these burgers will be a hunk of burning love at your cookout.        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>6 hamburger buns, split</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>½ pound bacon</li>
            <li>3 bananas</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>6 hamburger patties</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup creamy peanut butter, warmed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>

                    Heat a griddle over medium heat. Butter the inside slices of each burger bun, then toast in the skillet until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside.

                    Heat a large skillet over low heat; pan-fry the bacon for 2 minutes, then increase heat to medium-high and continue to pan-fry until crispy, 5 to 7 minutes, turning often. Drain on paper towels and discard most of the bacon grease.

                    Cut each banana lengthwise into long slices, about 4 inches in length. Pour the sugar into a small bowl, then add in the banana slices to coat both sides in sugar. Fry the banana slices in the same skillet over medium heat until caramelized, 2 to 3 minutes.    
                </p>
            </li>

                    Cook the burgers on a griddle over medium-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes per side, seasoning with salt and pepper. Press down firmly with a spatula to flatten the patties as they cook. A thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).

                    To assemble the burgers, lay down the bottom half the burger bun and spread on 1 tablespoon peanut butter. Place a burger patty on top, then add another tablespoon of peanut butter. Top with 2 to 3 slices of caramelized bananas, then 2 to 3 pieces of bacon. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon honey, then place the remaining burger bun on top.
